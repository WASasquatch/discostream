<font size="4.5">In the future, AI Art will become more and more popular as people become more interested in creating and viewing art that is created by machines. This type of art is already beginning to gain popularity and as technology advances, it is likely that AI Art will become even more widespread.

If you're interested in art and want to try something new, then you should definitely give AI Art a try. It's a fun and unique way to create art, and you may be surprised at how much you enjoy it.

Making text-to-image AI Art is actually quite easy, and anyone can do it with the right software, such as [Disco Diffusion](http://discodiffusion.com/). All you need is a computer with an internet connection and a bit of creativity.

Some people use text-2-image art generation to create images of famous quotes or to create images that look like they were hand-drawn.

Come and create something new and exciting with us!</font>
